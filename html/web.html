    <h1>Top five data visualizations tools for researchers</h1>

    <section id="intro">
        <p>In the realm of research, the ability to transform complex datasets into clear and engaging visuals can significantly enhance the impact of your work. At Decilion, we use data visualization tools to effectively communicate our findings. By leveraging the power of data visualization, we make our studies more accessible, understandable, and impactful. We bring this to researchers dedicated to public health and global health, ensuring that our insights can support and advance critical health initiatives worldwide.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="role">
        <h2>The role of data visualization in research</h2>
        <p>Data visualization plays a crucial role for us because it is an indispensable aspect of modern research. It transforms raw data into visual contexts, such as graphs, charts, and maps, making it easier to identify patterns, trends, and outliers. Effective visualizations can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Simplify complex information:</strong> Visual elements allow us to quickly grasp complicated data and trends. When data is presented visually, it becomes more accessible and less intimidating, enabling us to understand large datasets at a glance.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhance communication:</strong> Visuals are generally more effective than text alone, especially for those who may not be experts in the field. A well-crafted infographic can convey a message more clearly and effectively than a lengthy written report.</li>
            <li><strong>Facilitate insight:</strong> Data visualization aids in discovering insights that might be missed in text-based reports. When data is visualized, patterns and correlations become more apparent, helping researchers to draw meaningful conclusions. For example, a heatmap might highlight areas of high activity or interest, prompting further investigation into the underlying causes.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="analysis-focus">
        <h2>Analysis focus: World Health Statistics 2024</h2>
        <p>In this analysis, we will delve into the "World Health Statistics 2024" (<a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho/whs-annex">https://www.who.int/data/gho/whs-annex</a>) report, which includes tables of health statistics by country and area, WHO region, and globally. The data presented comprises official WHO statistics, focusing on selected health-related Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicators and Thirteenth General Programme of Work (GPW13) indicators, based on the latest available data from early 2024.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="tools">
